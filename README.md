### This is a part of Unsupervised Machine Learning Coursework. Please check each folder inside for implementations along with problem statements. The Work includes:

- Implemented clustering algorithms such as KNN, Kmeans, and Gaussian Mixture model etc.
- Analysed different feature selection algorithms along with Dimensionality reduction algorithms like PCA and HAAR like features for Images
- Worked on TensorfFlow AutoEncodings and Word Vectors along with Neural Nets and some supervised classification algorithms
- Implemented Sampling techniques and Summarization, Topic Modeling for Texts. 
- Worked on community detection in Social graphs and Recommender systems using collaborative filtering
Few Datasets used include 20 NewsGroups, MNIST, UCI/Household Dataset, DUC 2001 summarization dataset, MovieLens 100K Ratings and Friendster Social Graph
